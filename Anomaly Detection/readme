🚨 Anomaly Detection with PyOD
Anomaly detection is vital for identifying rare events like fraud, system failures, or cyber-attacks. This project leverages PyOD—a powerful Python toolkit—to analyze 17 benchmark datasets (.mat format), tackling varying sample sizes (148–49,097), feature dimensions (6–274), and outlier ratios (1.22%–35.90%).

🔧 Technologies Used
1. Python (Jupyter Notebook)
2. PyOD
3. NumPy, pandas, matplotlib
4. scipy.io.loadmat

✨ My Contributions
📁 1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded and standardized 17 datasets using PyOD's utilities.
Calculated and analyzed outlier percentages (e.g., musk: 3.17%, pima: 34.90%).

🧠 2. Algorithm Implementation
Applied 10 anomaly detection models:
Linear Models: PCA, MCD, One-Class SVM
Proximity-based: KNN, LOF, CBLOF, HBOS
Probabilistic: ABOD
Ensemble: Isolation Forest, Feature Bagging
Defined labels as 0 for inliers and 1 for outliers.

🔗 3. Combination Frameworks
Enhanced detection with ensemble score combinations:
Average, Maximization, AOM (Average of Maximum), MOA (Maximum of Average)

📊 4. Performance Evaluation
Measured:
ROC-AUC, precision@n, and execution time
Stored results in pandas DataFrames for comparison

🧪 Key Insights
PCA: Balanced speed and accuracy (cardio: 0.9616 ROC-AUC)
HBOS: Extremely fast (0.0107s), great on large datasets (e.g., shuttle: 0.9985 precision@n)
Isolation Forest: Strong all-rounder
Combinations improved performance on complex datasets (satimage-2, mnist)
No one-size-fits-all: performance varies with dataset characteristics

⚙️ Challenges Tackled
High-dimensional data (e.g., arrhythmia: 274 features)
Handling covariance errors in MCD
Robustness via ensemble score strategies
